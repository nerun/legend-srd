[Legend Core Rulebook](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/legend-core-rulebook?variant=42088757854455) was published by _Mongoose Publishing_ in 2011 and has been available in PDF format for just US$ 0.99 ever since.

This repository was created to make the _Legend System Reference Document_ available in UTF-8, more specifically in markdown, so that it can be read in any plain text editor such as Notepad. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a _Pull Request_.

This project is led by [Daniel Dias Rodrigues](https://github.com/nerun) (a.k.a. "Nerun"), from the Brazilian blog [GURPZine](https://www.gurpzine.com.br).

Please, take the time to read my very short [Apologetic manifest of the universal format](Apologetic%20manifest%20of%20the%20universal%20format.md), where I explain the reasons for this project, and for choosing the UTF-8 format and the markdown language.
