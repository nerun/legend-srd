# 9. Divine Magic

Whereas Common Magic is available directly to Adventurers, Divine Magic is not. Divine Magic is gifted by the gods and is usually available only through membership of a cult — and even then, only to cult members who have attained an appropriate level of standing within the cult. Lay members of a cult — those who follow the cult's precepts and generally adhere to the faith but make no formal commitment to it — have no access to Divine Magic. Initiates and above — those who have opted to serve the cult and their god directly — do have access to Divine Magic and Divine spells are often a significant enough lure to secure this depth of commitment.

## How Divine Magic Works

Divine Magic has a number of essential Characteristics separating it from other types of magic:

Spells offered reflect the god. –Unlike other forms of magic, where the Adventurer may seek out any spells he wishes, Divine Magic is inextricably linked to the god it springs from. No matter how great her faith, a priestess of the Moon Queen will never be able to hurl a blast of fire, as her divine patron has no authority over fire.

Divine spells are significantly more powerful than Common Magic spells in that no Magic Points are needed to cast them; instead they are channelled directly from the god. However, the amount and strength of Divine Magic any Adventurer can use is dependent on how deep a relationship that Adventurer has cultivated with his god, through the dedication of POW and increasing the pact with the deity.

Divine Magic relies on two skills: the Pact skill, which reflects the strength and depth of the divine relationship and is used to both gain and regain spells; and Lore (Specific Theology) to cast the spell.

## Pact (CHA+Dedicated POW)

Essentially a Pact is a commitment to serve a god through devoting one's soul through worship. The making of a Pact is represented by _dedicating_ one or more points of POW to the god. The Adventurer still possesses the POW for calculating skills but it is the god that harvests the Magic Points from the dedicated POW.

Making a Pact is simple: the Adventurer, at the point of cult initiation, declares how many points of POW he intends to dedicate to the Pact. He must dedicate a minimum of one point and a maximum of one quarter of his available POW. The dedicated POW then forms the basis of his Pact Skill.

An Adventurer may be initiated into more than one cult and thus have several concurrent Pact skills.

The Magic Points available to the Adventurer are limited to the amount of his _undedicated_ POW. Thus, an Adventurer with a POW of 12 dedicating 7 points to his cult would have only 5 Magic Points available for use elsewhere. Once a point of POW has been dedicated to a cult, it cannot be used for any other Pacts, _until membership of that cult is renounced_. Thus, a follower of the Thunder God with a POW of 10 might dedicate six points to the Thunderer cult but this would leave only a further four points to be dedicated to another cult. Leaving a cult reduces the related Pact skill to zero and prevents him from using any Divine Magic from that god — but releases the POW previously dedicated to that Pact.

Dedicated POW forms the basis of a 'pool' of points used to power Divine Magic spells. _For example, a priest with 4 POW dedicated to his god has 4 POW to invest in Divine spells._

The starting value of the Pact skill is equal to CHA + Dedicated POW. Like any other skill it can be developed through the spending of Improvement rolls, improving the CHA characteristic, or dedicating further POW. Pact can also be increased in other ways, as the Pact Improvement table, following, demonstrates. The higher the Pact skill, the more dedicated the follower. It is not a measure of how much an Adventurer knows about the cult or god; that is still measured by the Lore (Specific Theology) skill.

#### Multiple Pacts

Adventurers may join more than one cult, thereby establishing more than one Pact with a deity — as long as the different cults are compatible (being allied in some way or a sub-cult of a larger organisation). The only restriction on having multiple cult membership is the amount of POW the Adventurer is willing or able to devote to each Pact: a Pact always requires a dedication of at least one POW.

##### Pact Improvement

| Circumstance                                                | Pact Improvement |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Undertaking and completing a great quest for your god or cult. | 1D10+         |
| Undertaking an unsuccessful great quest.                       | 1D6           |
| Undertaking a successful lesser quest for your god or cult.    | 1D4+1         |
| Undertaking an unsuccessful lesser quest for your god or cult. | 1D2           |
| Dedicating more POW to the Pact.                               | 1 per point of POW dedicated |
| Emulating the behaviour of your god in extreme circumstances.  | 1 point per instance |

These improvements are in addition to any Improvement rolls an Adventurer wants to use for developing the relationship with his god.

As the Pact increases, so does the propensity to act in the way or ways the god or focus of veneration acts. _The higher the Pact, the more like the god, or object of veneration, the character becomes_. Thus his character, judgements, deeds and actions reflect those of his god, because the character is essentially becoming more and more like his god. This kind of behaviour requires roleplaying for its effectiveness and Games Masters should watch for situations where the strength of the Pact will assert itself in an Adventurer's actions. Adventurers can, as their Pact increases, undergo complete personality changes as a result, although the circumstances where this happens are judgement calls for the Games Master.

### Quests

Gods demand service from their followers, in the form of quests. The nature and scope of the quest varies from deity to deity. A servant of the Thunderer, for example, might be sent to slay a terrible frost-worm that dwells atop a distant mountain. Those who worship the Green might be charged with bringing water to the desert lands, so they bloom with new life. Most quests involve furthering the god's aims, protecting other worshippers, gathering new followers, or thwarting enemies. Not every quest involves travel or adventure; the god of knowledge might demand that a petitioner solve an ancient riddle or obtain a copy of a lost book of secret wisdom.

Many cults have rituals or myth-cycles that must be enacted again and again as lesser quests. For example, to advance in the cult of the Thunderer, Alaric must enter the underground pits in the Vale of Storms and fight his way past the snake-men who dwell there until he finds the Great Green Gong and sounds it. Completing this lesser quest increases his Pact score by 1D4+1%. Every aspiring follower of the Thunderer in Alaric's tribe undertakes this quest.

By contrast, every great quest is unique and extremely perilous. Great quests do not re-enact tired old ancient myths — they forge brave new legends! 

#### Limits to Dedicated POW

The amount of POW that can be dedicated to any particular Pact is dependent on the rank and the cult itself. Some cults will have a minimum dedication but all cults have a maximum dedication, based on the rank. The Cults section of this chapter provides more detail on the different ranks.

Lay Member (Level 0) — No Dedicated POW
Initiate (Level 1) — ¼ of POW
Acolyte (Level 2) — ½ of POW
Priest (Level 3) — ¾ of POW
High Priest (Level 4) — All POW

### Lore (Specific Theology) (INT x2)

A specific theology skill is associated with every god. Thus Lore (The Thunderer) exists discretely from Lore (Moon Goddess). The skill is used in two ways: first as a measure of the knowledge the Adventurer has of the god's myths, aspects, behaviour and so forth and of the rituals, ceremonies and practices associated with the god's cult. Secondly Lore (Specific Theology) is used as the skill roll for casting any Divine Spells associated with the god successfully. So, an Adventurer with Lore (The Thunderer) 60% has a 60% chance to cast any of the Divine Spells he has gained from his worship of the Thunder God.

If a deity is part of a wider pantheon then the Adventurer understands the Lore of gods associated with the pantheon at half his Lore (Specific Theology) value but he cannot use this to cast Divine Spells. Pantheistic cults do, frequently, teach the spells from one member god to cult members of an allied cult and where this is permissible then the Adventurer uses his full Lore (Specific Theology) for spell casting.

### Casting Divine Magic

Divine Magic spells are prayed for by the worshipper before they can be called upon. Each Divine spell takes up a single point of _Dedicated POW_ to store. However, Divine Spells do not cost any Magic Points when cast, as the caster is channelling the power of their god and is not fuelling the spell through his own, personal, magical reserves.

> #### Alaric's Tale
>
> _Alaric has become an Initiate of the Thunderer, a cult strongly represented in his own community._
>
> _In becoming an Initiate Alaric has dedicated 4 POW to the Pact, giving him a Pact (The Thunderer) 14%. His POW, for the purposes of available Magic Points, is lowered from 14 to 10 but it also means that Alaric has four points that can be dedicated towards the Thunder God's Divine Magic._
>
> _Alaric also has Lore (The Thunderer) 52%. The skill means that any Divine Magic spells Alaric gains as an initiate of the cult are cast at 52%. It also means that Alaric knows the lore of the associated cult, the Runefather, at 26% because the Thunderer and the Runefather are father and son in the same pantheon. However Alaric cannot cast any Runefather Divine spells unless they are taught to him as part of allied cult rituals. If he gains any allied cult spells then they will operate at 52%, his Lore (The Thunderer percentage._
>
> _So at this point in his life Alaric's understanding of the Thunderer is reasonably strong as he has spent most of his life exposed to its rituals and practices. However his direct relationship with the Thunderer, represented by his Pact, is still very weak. Alaric has only just embarked on the road of devotion to his god and will need to strengthen and deepen his Pact over time._

As a measure of the faith of the worshipper, when a Divine spell is cast it possesses an inherent Magnitude of one tenth of the caster's Pact skill. Priests and High Priests are able to channel so much of their god's power that their spells are exceptionally hard to block or dismiss.

The same Divine Spell can be learned multiple times.

To cast the spell the Adventurer must successfully roll against his Lore (Specific Theology). Note the result of the roll.

**Critical Success:** The spell is cast and may be cast again. It is not placed beyond use.

**Success:** The spell is cast successfully and is then placed beyond use until the Adventurer can regain it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

**Failure:** The spell does not work but the Adventurer can attempt to cast it again later.

**Fumble:** The spell does not work and is also placed beyond use until the Adventurer can regain it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

When a spell is placed beyond use it is not forgotten; it is merely the case that the Adventurer cannot channel his god's power via that spell again, until he has successfully regained the god's ongoing trust in their relationship.

#### Regaining Divine Spells

Depending on their rank within the cult, a spell can be regained upon a successful Pact test, showing that the Adventurer has re-established their faith with the god and is able to channel that god's power once more through the Divine spell.

> #### Alaric's Tale
>
> _As a Thunderer initiate, Alaric learns Lightning Strike, Blessing (Spear and Shield), Shield and Channel Strength. This takes all of his 4 points of Dedicated POW to store. The spells are cast at Alaric's Lore (the Thunderer) of 52%. His Pact (the Thunderer) of 14% governs the Magnitude of all the Divine Spells he can cast: at a tenth of his Pact, rounded up, each of his four Divine Spells can be cast at Magnitude 2 (14/10 = 1.4, rounded to 2)._
> 
> _During an adventure Alaric successfully casts Shield. As the spell was a standard success he cannot use it again until he has returned to a shrine of the Thunderer and succeeded in a Pact roll of 16% or less._
>
> _Later in the same adventure Alaric critically succeeds in casting Channel Strength. This means he can use Channel Strength again without having to attempt a Pact roll to re-establish his relationship with the Thunderer. He is forced to cast Channel Strength once more but this time fumbles in the attempt; not only does the spell fail to work but this level of failure places the spell beyond Alaric's use until he can return to a shrine and attempt a Pact roll to recover it._

**Lay Members** — No access to Divine spells.

**Initiates** — May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used but must return to a shrine or temple to pray for the spell. It requires a successful Pact test to recover; failure requires that they try again the following day.

**Acolytes** — May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used; however, if the test fails they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.

- Priests — Lords — May test to regain a Divine spell an hour after it was used; however, if the test fails they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.

**High Priests** — May test to regain Divine spells an hour after they have been used; failing the roll simply incurs a delay of another hour before they can try again, whereas a fumble means the spell must be recovered at a temple.

#### Dismissing Divine Magic Spells

Like Common Magic, a caster can dismiss any Divine Magic spell(s) he has cast as a single Combat Action. Ceasing to maintain a Concentration spell is immediate and not a Combat Action.

An Adventurer may also willingly release a Divine Magic spell from their Dedicated POW. This immediately frees the spell from their psyche, harmlessly dissipating the divine link and liberating the point of Dedicated POW to store a different spell if desired.

### Acquiring Divine Magic

Learning Divine Magic requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To acquire a _new_ Divine Magic spell, the Adventurer must possess the Lore (Specific Theology) skill appropriate to the religion from which the spell is requested and be of sufficient rank within the cult.

##### Learning a new Divine Magic Spell

| Minimum Cult Rank of Spell | Minimum Temple Requirement | Cost | Prayer Time |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|------|-------------|
| Initiate                   | Shrine                     | 1 Improvement Roll | 1 day |
| Acolyte                    | Minor Temple               | 2 Improvement Rolls | 2 days |
| Priest or High Priest      | Major Temple               | 3 Improvement Rolls | 3 days |

The Minimum Cult Rank denotes the rank the Adventurer must be within the cult to be granted access to that spell. The most powerful Divine Magic is withheld for those who have proven their faith and prowess.

The Minimum Temple Requirement represents the fact that the character must be at a sufficiently holy site in order for the god in question to grant the spell to the Adventurer. Such temples will also have experienced Acolytes or Priests that can aid the Adventurer in their religious supplications. Once learned, the Adventurer must return to a temple of similar status in order to regain the spell.

The Cost of the spell is how many Improvement Rolls it takes to learn a new Divine spell. Once taught, there is no further cost to regain the spell by prayer.

Depending on the setting, cults rarely charge a monetary cost for learning Divine Magic, although they sometimes set tests for worshippers to prove themselves worthy of being granted such spells. This is for the simple reason that anyone learning Divine Magic from a cult is already an active member and it benefits the cult to make active members more powerful.

## Divine Magic Spell Traits and Descriptions

Every Divine Magic spell is defined by a series of traits describing the spell and how it is used in the game. A description then follows describing the spell's precise effects. By default, the Magnitude of any Divine spell is equal to one tenth of the caster's Pact. Unless specifically stated in its description, Divine Spells take one Combat Action to invoke. The other traits used by Divine Magic spells are detailed here.

**Area (X):** The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

**Concentration:** The spell's effects remain in place as long as the Adventurer concentrates on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spellcaster to continue to gesture with both arms, chant and ignore distractions.

**Duration (X):** The spell's effects stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.

**Instant:** The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell then disappears.

**Ranged:** Ranged spells may be cast upon targets up to a maximum distance of the Adventurer's POW x 10 in metres.

**Rank:** The minimum cult rank the spell is available to.

**Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience):** The spell's effects do not occur automatically. The target may make an Opposed Evade, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade) spells require the target to be able to use a Combat Action in order to dodge.

**Touch:** Touch spells require the character to actually touch his target for the spell to take effect. The spellcaster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

### Absorption

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell absorbs incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, converting their magical energy into Magic Points which are then available to the target. Once cast on a subject, Absorption will attempt to absorb the effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting an Adventurer. The effects of Absorption depend on the relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell — see the Absorption Results table for more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled and has no effect.

##### Absorption Results

| Incoming Spell's Magnitude is... | Effect |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| Equal to or weaker than Absorption's Magnitude. | Incoming spell absorbed and Absorption remains. |
| 1 or more points stronger than Absorption's Magnitude. | Absorption eliminated and incoming spell takes effect. |

An Adventurer may not accumulate more Magic Points than his undedicated POW while Absorption is in effect — excess Magic Points garnered through Absorption simply vanish. Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and Spirit Block.

### Alter Target

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Ranged

The caster of this spell has the ability to re-direct ranged attacks away from their intended target. Each missile attack or spell of lesser Magnitude requires a Combat Action to deflect, turning it away from its original target and towards another victim of the caster's choice. This new recipient has to be a viable target for the source of the attack and cannot be the original source of the attack.

### Amplify

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

The caster requests that his god boosts the magical abilities of the recipient. While the spell is in effect all castings of Common Magic with the Progressive trait have their Magnitude boosted by the Magnitude of this spell. No Common Magic spell can have its Magnitude boosted beyond  10. This increase in Magnitude does not cost the recipient any more Magic Points than normal.

_For example, Thrace casts a Magnitude 3 Bladesharp, spending the required 3 Magic Points and makes the Common Magic Skill Test. Since he is currently under the effects of a Magnitude 5 Amplify cast by Lilina a few minutes before, the Bladesharp counts as having been cast with Magnitude 8 for all purposes._ 

### Aphrodisiac

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell increases the target's sexual attraction. Any failed Influence or Streetwise rolls toward members of the opposite sex (or those of the same sex that would find the target sexually attractive), are treated as successes instead. Fumbles, normal successes and criticals are unaffected. Aphrodisiac makes all opposite-sex individuals around the target friendlier and more focussed upon them — which could be a very good or very bad thing depending on the circumstances.

### Beast Form

Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell transforms the caster and all his personal belongings into an animal that is sacred to his cult or faith. The caster retains his INT, CHA and POW scores but exchanges his STR, DEX, CON and SIZ scores for average values of the animal shape and gains a bonus to each physical Characteristic of +1 per point of Magnitude. He also gains the natural abilities of the creature. The animal cannot be mystical or magical in any way and the Games Master should have the final say as to what manner of creature would fit a specific cult if it is not obvious.

### Behold

Duration 15, Rank Initiate

The caster sees what another cult member of equal or lesser rank is currently experiencing. The image is from the point of view of the cult member being beheld, so there could be some confusion as to what is happening in certain circumstances (member is sleeping, blindfolded and so on). This spell does not convey sound, only image and if the member is dead or magically protected against scrying by a spell of greater Magnitude the caster will be rendered effectively blind for the duration.

### Berserk

Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

The recipient of this spell is overcome with bloodlust, causing him to disregard his own safety and loyalties but imbuing him with tremendous stamina and combat ability.

For the spell's duration the Close Combat skills of the recipient are increased by half again, his Damage Modifier increased by one step and he automatically succeeds any opposed or unopposed Resilience or Fatigue test... although a Major wound will still incapacitate him. However, in return the subject may not Parry, Evade or cast any magic while under the influence of Berserk.

Unwilling targets receive a chance to resist. Normally, the recipient remains in the Berserk state for the entire duration of the spell but Games Masters may allow a Berserk Adventurer to shake off the effects with an unopposed Persistence test. At the end of the spell, the recipient immediately drops two Fatigue levels. Berserk may not be combined with Fanaticism — Berserk will always take precedence in such cases.

### Bless Crops

Duration Special, Rank Priest, Touch

Cast on cultivated farmland Bless Crops affects a number of square kilometres equal to the Magnitude of the spell. It guarantees a harvest if maintained for a year irrespective of weather or other conditions. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained.

### Blessing

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell grants a bonus to a cult skill. The target receives a bonus of +5% per Magnitude of the spell. The specific skill is determined by the caster but must be one of the cult's skills. For instance, an Earth Cult might grant a bonus to Craft (Masonry) but a War Cult could grant the bonus to all Weapon Skills. This bonus cannot be stacked with any other spell-effect bonuses.

### Breathe Water

Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Breath Water allows an air-breathing creature to breathe water (the subject will still be able to breathe air as well), for up to one hour per point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered or released, until the spell ends.

### Call Winds

Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

Allows the caster to summon or bend the winds to his will, in an area whose diameter is equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. The maximum strength of winds the caster can control or invoke depends on their Cult Rank. Acolytes can summon up to Moderate Winds, Priests up to Gales and High Priests up to Hurricanes (see Wind Strength page 232). If the caster can control the wind he may reduce it to Calm or change its direction if desired. This spell cannot alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.

### Channel Strength

Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Through this spell the caster can help to prevent the target from suffering from the ill effects of Fatigue. The target of this spell will not receive another level of Fatigue for up to one hour per point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered or released, until the spell ends.

### Clear Skies

Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell grants a short reprieve from poor weather. The caster creates mild, pleasant weather conditions in an area with a diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Rain stops, sweltering heat becomes cool breezes and dark clouds separate to reveal the bright and warming sun. This spell cannot alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.

### Consecrate

Area Special, Duration Special, Rank Priest

This spell is as much a part of a temple's foundation as is its cornerstone but may actually be cast almost anywhere. It creates a sphere with a radius of 10 metres per point of Magnitude. The consecrated sphere is sacred to the spellcaster's god. Consecrate by itself does nothing to keep outsiders at bay but the caster of the spell will know immediately if a spell, spirit or someone who is not a member of his cult crosses the boundaries of the Consecrate spell.

While within the area of a Consecrate spell, an Initiate of the same religion gains a bonus to Lore (Specific Theology) tests made to cast Divine Magic spells equal to 5% per point of Magnitude. Initiates of other gods suffer an equal penalty to such tests.

Consecrate requires one hour per point of Magnitude to cast. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained. It is usually the duty of the Priest in charge of a temple or shrine to maintain the spell.

### Crash of Thunder

Area Special, Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to summon a powerful blast of thunder from the open sky, directed toward his foes. The spell affects an area around the caster equal to 10 times the Magnitude in metres, forcing all non-Cult members to resist the spell. Those who fail are knocked from their feet for 1D2 Combat Actions and struck deaf for 1D6 minutes. Should anyone fumble the Resistance roll against the spell, they are struck permanently deaf. Also, any items of glass or pottery will shatter automatically within the area of the spell.

### Cure Disease/Poison

Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell lifts the effects of any mundane disease or poison afflicting the target; or magical ones whose potency is less than the Pact % of the caster.

If the disease is the result of a Disease Spirit and therefore magical in nature, the spell exorcises the Spirit as long its POW is within three times the spell's Magnitude. _For example, a Magnitude 5 Cure Disease/Poison will exorcise any Disease Spirit of POW 15 or less_.

### Disarm

Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence)

This spell gives the caster a powerful ability to take weaponry from the hands of a number of targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell. When cast, the target makes a Resistance roll for every weapon or shield in their hands at the time. Each failed roll means that the item is flung or torn from the target and lands 1D6 metres away in the direction toward the caster. It obviously has no effect on natural weaponry of any type.

### Dismiss Elemental

Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Resilience)

Dismiss Elemental may be cast against Gnomes, Salamanders, Shades, Sylphs or Undines. The spell affects an elemental of up to one cubic metre in size per point of Magnitude. Failure to resist the spell causes the elemental to be dismissed and leaves the material substance of its body in place.

### Dismiss Magic

Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate

Dismiss Magic may be cast against either a general target or a specific spell. Dismiss Magic will eliminate a combined Magnitude of spells equal to its own Magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's Magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end and no more spells will be eliminated. A spell cannot be partially eliminated, so a target under the effects of a spell whose Magnitude is higher than that of Dismiss Magic will not have any spells currently affecting it eliminated. The caster can also target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell.

As long as Dismiss Magic's Magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's Magnitude, the target spell is eliminated. Dismiss Magic may be fired _defensively_ to neutralise incoming offensive spells, by using the _Cast Spell_ Combat Action.

### Ebb and Flow

Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Ranged

This spell allows a caster to seriously speed up or slow down a water-going vessel of any kind by forcing the water it rests in to either push faster or work against it. The caster can increase a craft's speed by half-again, or decrease it to one-half, chosen at the time of the spell's casting. The spell continues until dropped, allowing for higher-powered castings of the spell to make considerable changes to travel time by boat, ship or raft. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained.

### Eclipse

Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell turns day into night for a short period of time. Animals flee in confusion, people tend to question what they are seeing and fear is widespread. Whatever the reason for doing so, the caster can choose whether it is twilight or midnight black in an area whose diameter is equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres.

### Elemental Summoning

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell summons forth an elemental associated with the god's portfolio. For example cults associated with an Earth god would summon Gnomes. The caster summons an elemental of one cubic metre per point of Magnitude in 1D3 Combat Rounds and remains in the area for the entire spell duration. For obvious reasons, the caster must have access to the same volume of the element's material to cast this spell successfully. If less volume is available, then the caster can animate the material with a smaller elemental if desired. The elemental follows the directions of the caster for the duration of the spell but disperses once the spell expires.

### Evergreen

Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bless a single plant to become immune to the ravages of natural weather. A tree will not lose its leaves, flowers will not cease to bud and bloom even in winter and vines sprawl through the withering heat of high summer. Although this spell alters the natural state of the enchanted plant, it remains healthy — although some plants may not be able to seed if enchanted in this manner. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained.

### Excommunicate

Permanent, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell takes one hour to cast and severs the mystical link a worshipper enjoys with his god, causing the target of the spell to immediately and permanently lose all Divine Magic from the caster's cult. In addition, the target also loses the Pact skill, freeing any POW dedicated to the god. The target will never again be able to learn or use Divine Magic spells from the cult, though he will still be able to use Lore (Specific Theology) for purely academic purposes.

### Exorcism

Instant, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

By means of this spell, a divine spellcaster calls upon their god to drive out a spirit currently possessing a corporeal being. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is immaterial. The spellcaster must be open to the spirit world in order to cast this spell — he may not be shielded by a Spirit Block, or similar effect.

The spirit receives a –5% penalty per point of Magnitude to resist the spell. Failure severs the possession but leaves the spirit free to engage any _other_ nearby target in Spirit Combat if it desires. Thus this spell can be potentially dangerous for the caster.

### Extension

Duration Special, Rank Acolyte

This spell lengthens the duration of any Divine Magic spell with the Duration trait, for as long as the caster wishes to maintain it. Extension, and the spell it is extending, is cast simultaneously by the caster — this is an exception to the normal rule that only one Divine Magic spell may be cast during a single Combat Action.

If the Extension spell fails to cast while the augmented spell succeeds, the augmented spell is not extended and operates normally. If the augmented spell fails to cast while the Extension spell succeeds, the Extension spell is not cast.

Extension prevents recovery or release of both the extended spell and the Extension itself, for as long as the spell is maintained.

### Fear

Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell causes the target to be gripped with overwhelming fear. Fear has no effect on unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are currently under the effect of another emotion controlling spell of higher Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist flee in terror for a number of minutes equal to the Magnitude of the spell. Victims will avoid engaging in combat unless forced to.

### Fog

Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

The caster creates a thick fog that obscures all vision and muffles hearing, in an area with a diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Anyone caught in the fog has their Perception skill reduced by half. The fog will remain in the area it was cast but can be pushed away or dispersed by a significantly strong wind. This spell is useful for stealthily moving large numbers of animals or troops.

### Gleam

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell enchants a single weapon with a speck of bright light that dances along its edge, always shining through the eyes of the target opposing its attacks. Anyone attempting to Parry or Evade a weapon currently under the effects of Gleam has their Skill Tests reduced by –5% per point of Magnitude, due to the dazzling light. Gleam is incompatible with any damage boosting or weapon skill improving magic, such as Bladesharp, Bludgeon or similar spells.

### Heal Body

Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This powerful spell instantly heals a number of Hit Locations equal to its Magnitude. Each Hit Location thus healed is restored to its maximum Hit Points. The caster may choose which Hit Locations are healed. Heal Body will even heal maimed, or reattach severed, locations if cast within an hour of receiving the Major Wound. Beyond this period the Regrow Limb spell is required.

### Heal Mind

Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell gives the caster the ability to remove derangements from a single target. In the case of magically-induced madness or similar instabilities, the spell works on a permanent basis if its Magnitude is equal to or greater than that of the magical disorder.

### Heal Wound

Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

Heals one location back to its full Hit Points but will not cause a severed limb to reattach or regenerate.

### Illusion

Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist Special

This spell is used to temporarily modify the sensory _projections_ of a single target, for example a cow can be made to look like a tiger, sound like a howling wolf when it moos, smell of roses, taste of butterscotch, feel like it is icy cold, or a combination of these. The caster can adjust one sensory projection per point of Magnitude. Once set, the illusion can no longer be modified for the duration of the spell.

Depending on the target, the illusion can extend up to its Magnitude in metres in any dimension. To cover a larger target, multiple castings of Illusion can be combined together, thus a small fortress could be made to appear as a briar covered hill for example.

If the spell is cast directly upon an unwilling living target, it may resist with its Resilience. Observers who interact with the illusion are permitted an opposed Persistence roll against the spell, in order to resist any debilitating psychosomatic effects it creates, i.e. deafness, pain, nausea and so on. The illusion itself is incapable of causing harm but the underlying target remains as dangerous as it was before the spell.

### Laughter

Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell infects the caster's foes with laughter, making common activity difficult and exhausting. The caster picks a number of targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell, who all must resist the spell individually. Those who fail are subject to gut-wrenching laughter for the duration of the spell, suffering a — 20% penalty to all DEX-related Skill Tests and a level of Fatigue when the spell expires.

### Lightning Strike

Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Evade)

This spell causes a sizzling bolt of lightning to streak from the hand of the caster toward the target. If the bolt is not evaded, the spell will cause 3D6 damage to a specified Hit Location. Natural and worn armour offers no protection against this damage but magical protection does. However, any _magical_ Armour Points the target possesses are reduced by 1 AP per point of Magnitude.

### Madness

Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell causes the target to lose contact with reality and become a gibbering loon. Madness has no effect on unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are currently under the effect of another sanity influencing spell of greater Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist, gibber and rave uncontrollably for a number of minutes equal to the Magnitude of the spell. Victims will perform random Combat Actions during this period. Roll 1D6. 1: Move to Close Combat attack a random target. 2: Run in a random direction. 3: Cast a spell at random target. 4: Use ranged attack against random target. 5: Shout at random target. 6: Dance wildly. In non-combat situations, the Games Master should allow the target to perform passive but perhaps more frightening or entertaining actions.

### Meditate

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell grants a single target the ability to regain their magical strength through mystic meditation. This requires the target to spend a quarter of an hour in solitude without interruption but will replenish all of the target's spent Magic Points after that time. This meditation is not deep and can be interrupted by any outside contact but the target can make a Persistence Skill Test to ignore any outside stimuli that might wake him (as long as it is not a direct attack).

### Mindblast

Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell applies a penalty to the victim's INT equal to the Magnitude of the spell. This may cause the target to lose access to some Sorcery spells, or reduce the maximum magnitude of cast Common Magic. If the target's INT is reduced below 8 they lose the power of speech and become animalistic in their thought processes.

### Mindlink

Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This spell allows the transmission of conscious thoughts, spell knowledge and Magic Points between participants. Each point of Magnitude in Mindlink allows mind-to-mind communication between two people, either creating several separate pairs of Mindlinked people, or making the caster the central hub of a small Mindlink network. In the second case, only the 'central' Adventurer is linked directly to other participants. Thus, if Alaric is linked to Lilina and Thrace, Lilina and Thrace are not linked to each other.

Mindlink must be cast upon all participants at the same time and it is limited to consenting participants. Those participating in a Mindlink may use the spells and Magic Points of others they are linked to without consent but only if they have the appropriate skill to cast it, i.e. to use one of Alaric's Divine spells, Lilina must possess the Lore (the Thunderer) skill. Divine spells used in this way must be recovered normally by the original owner.

Participants in a Mindlink have a special vulnerability to INT, POW, CHA and morale-effecting spells. Such a spell cast against any member of a Mindlink will affect all those connected, though all participants are entitled to resist individually.

Although participants in a Mindlink share Magic Points and conscious thought, they remain their own entity. Mindlink does not include hidden thoughts, memories, unconscious urges, skills or permanent spell knowledge. Any participant may sever their connection to the Mindlink as a Combat Action, or by leaving the spell's range.

### Rain

Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bring rain from a clear sky. For the duration of the spell rain falls from the sky in an area whose diameter equals the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. The rain can be as heavy or light as the caster desires, though not heavy enough to cause severe flooding but can be the difference between life and death for plants and thirsty men. If Rain is cast in sub zero temperatures, snow is created instead.

### Reflection

Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This spell reflects incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, redirecting the spell back at the original caster. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting the target. The effects of Reflection depend on the relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell — see the Reflection Results table for more details.

Reflection is incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block.

##### Reflection Results

| Incoming Spell's Magnitude is... | Effect |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| Equal to or weaker than Reflection's Magnitude. | Incoming spell reflected and Reflection remains. |
| 1 or more points stronger than Reflection's Magnitude. | Reflection eliminated and incoming spell takes effect. |

### Regenerate Limb

Concentration Special, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell causes a location severed or maimed by a Major Wound to regenerate, or if the detached location is still present, for it to reattach itself to its stump.

Regenerate Limb takes a number of rounds equal to the location's HP to reattach or repair, during which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. The Hit Location is immediately restored to 1 Hit Point at the end of this period. Regenerating a severed location works the same way but takes minutes instead of rounds.

### Resurrect

Concentration Special, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell brings the dead back to life. The body of the deceased must be present and cannot be lacking any Hit Locations vital for life. If the target died due to disease or poison, the ailment must be eliminated first or the spell will fail.

Resurrect summons the deceased spirit to approach its former body. The caster of the spell must then persuade the returning spirit to re-enter its body — while those with unfinished aims or seeking revenge may be more than willing to return to life, those who died in lingering pain due to old age or persistent illness may be less than happy at a return to corporeality and may resist the summoning.

Resurrect takes a number of hours equal to the target's POW Characteristic to take effect, during which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. A resurrected Adventurer returns to life with zero Hit Points on all locations.

After death, Resurrect must be cast within a number of days equal to the Magnitude of the spell, otherwise the magic automatically fails.

### Sever Spirit

Instant, Rank Priest, Resist (Resilience)

This spell severs the bond between body and soul, to devastating effect. The target may resist the spell by opposing his Resilience with the caster's Lore (Specific Theology) roll made to cast the spell. If the resistance attempt fails, then the target dies. If the resistance roll succeeds, then the target takes one point of damage for every two points of Magnitude of the spell to each Hit Location simultaneously. This may, in some cases, still result in the death of the spell's target, if further Resilience rolls for the damage sustained are failed.

### Shield

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point of Magnitude _either_ gives the caster one Armour Point on all Hit Locations or one point of magical protection, as per Countermagic Shield, or a combination thereof. These effects are cumulative with other Common Magic spells, as well as any physical armour the caster is wearing. Shield is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Spirit Block, as well as further castings of Shield on the same recipient.

### Soul Sight

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell allows the recipient to see the POW aura of anyone he looks at, enabling him to discern that creature's current Magic Points, as well as the nature of any active spells, the source of their magic and any enchanted items the creature is carrying. It also allows the recipient to see into the spirit world.

### Spirit Block

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Spirit Block is one of the most powerful ways in which to block the malign influence of ghosts, wraiths and other creatures of the spirit world. The recipient of Spirit Block may only be affected by spirits with a POW greater than the spell's Magnitude, squared.

##### Spirit Block Effectiveness

| Spirit Block's Magnitude | Recipient May Only Be Harmed By Spirits With... |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1                        | POW 2 or higher                                 |
| 2                        | POW 5 or higher                                 |
| 3                        | POW 10 or higher                                |
| 4                        | POW 17 or higher                                |
| 5                        | POW 26 or higher                                |
| 6                        | POW 37 or higher                                |
| 7                        | POW 50 or higher                                |
| 8                        | POW 65 or higher                                |
| 9                        | POW 82 or higher                                |
| 10                       | POW 101 or higher                               |

Spirit Block is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Shield.

### Sunspear

Instant, Ranged, Rank Priest, Resist (Evade)

This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast a shaft of light, two metres wide, streaks from the sky to blast a single target. If the target does not evade, the blazing light will burn it for 2D6 damage per Hit Location (roll separately for each location). Armour Points are not effective against this damage and it counts as both magical and fire damage.

### Sureshot

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Sureshot magically guides the trajectory of missiles thrown or fired by the recipient so that they almost always hit, no matter the situational modifiers or cover, as long as the target is within range of the weapon.

For the duration of the spell, any failed missile attack roll is treated as a success instead. Fumbles, normal successes and criticals remain unaffected. The target of the missile attack can still attempt to Parry or Evade as normal.

Sureshot may not be combined with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart — Sureshot will always take precedence in such cases. Precise Attack attempts do not work whilst this spell is operating.

### True (Weapon)

Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Cast on the specified type of Close Combat Weapon, this spell doubles that weapon's normal damage dice. Other bonuses, such as Damage Modifiers, are not affected. The wielder of the weapon should roll the weapon's damage twice and total the result.
